You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Notes / To be done

- there is CLEAR on the bottom individual start/end Date Picker popup
- data-copy is an sample from repo of the original data being passed, some items wrongly formatted, startDate > endDate ?
- public index.html has commented out incomplete addCampaigns functions which attach it to global window object.
- how can addCampaigns function be invoked from console? Local/SessionStorage to be used to persist and read from?
